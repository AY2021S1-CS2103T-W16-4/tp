## Project: ATAS

**ATAS** is a desktop application designed to be a handy in-class companion for CS1010S Teaching Assistants. 
It aims to **elevate users' efficiency** and make their experience of handling administrative tasks as **seamless** as possible. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to enter a session.
  * What it does: allows the user to enter a session to view the presence and participation status of the students.
  * Justification: This feature limits the user to toggle the presence and participation status of the students only when he or she is in a session.
  * Highlights: The implementation was quite tricky as it required changes to existing commands and the usage had to be limited to a particular tab.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=CodingCookieRookie&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
